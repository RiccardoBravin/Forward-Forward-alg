     </div>


# Description
C++ implementation of Hinton's Forward Forward algorithm

# Features
Analizing the content of Hinton's paper "The Forward-Forward Algorithm: Some Preliminary Investigations" and by searching for existing python implementations i tried to create a complete program to load and learn data with the use of just standard libraries which could thus be imported in low power devices such as Arduino 

# How to run:
- Step 1: dowload the MNIST dataset in .txt format from [here](https://github.com/halimb/MNIST-txt)
- Step 2: place the dataset in the same folder as the one with the code
- Step 3: compile the code with  ```g++ .\main.cpp -std=c++17 -O3 -fopenmp -o FF.exe``` 
- Step 4: execute the code with ```.\FF.exe```
